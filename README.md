##Face Detection in Images using OpenCV and Haar Cascades


✓This project demonstrates how to perform face detection in images using Python and OpenCV within a Jupyter notebook environment. Face detection is achieved using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier, which is a machine learning-based approach.
